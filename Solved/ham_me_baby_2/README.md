	you will be receiving hamming(7,4) codes. your job is to send data bits
	from a 7 bit hamming code.

	|  FLAG WILL BE PRINTED AFTER YOU SEND CORRECT DATA BITS 100 TIMES  |
	|___________________________________________________________________|

	               the order of the bits followed is

	                    P1 P2 D3 P4 D5 D6 D7


	and come back here. remember somebits could be flipped. you need to send
	correct data bits.
